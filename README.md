# Valyrian Wordle

Valyrian Wordle is a re-implementation of the modern classic [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) into the constructed language of High Valyrian, constructed by David J. Peterson for George RR Martin's A Song of Ice of Fire and HBO's Game of Thrones.

This project was originally forked from [Latin-Wordle](https://github.com/theotarr/latin-wordle) under MIT license.
